5DATA : Data Engineering – Project

 

General considerations

 

The project must be carried out by group: 2 to 4 students max
Project duration : 4 weeks
Rendering :
- a pdf or docx file containing:
- the description of the project
- general and functional specifications
- the architecture of the platform
- an appendix containing the codes
Your rendering must be uploaded on canvas as a Zip File : ID-Name-Firstname-campus.
The quality of writing and the justification of the choices will be criteria to be taken into account during the notation.
The proposed architecture will be a key element in the rating
The project must be presented to the class and the quality of the presentation, the relevance of the arguments and the answers to the questions will be careers to take into account for the evaluation.
The achievement, even a summary, will be an important criterion in the evaluation
The integration of the maximum of technologies seen in progress will be a plus for the evaluation
This is voluntarily an open project to allow you to add functionalities which will be taken into account during the evaluation
 

Project Description :

 

You are hired within SUPINFO International University, leader in digital training: IT, Business, Communication and Design, in order to set up a business intelligence platform and monitor the flows of students, administrative and supervisory staff.


Project description.


It is a question of offering a "Big Data Engineering" platform, Data Scientist & Big Data Engineer for:

Participate in the design, implementation and deployment of an architecture for:
collect,
cleansing
storing
analyze data
from students,
their regions of origin,
their institutions of origin,
their mobility,
the monitoring their curriculum,
attendance,
internships and businesses
Organization for Professional Contract

This first part is fundamental because it will condition the rest of the project

 

As the data to be represented are heterogeneous, propose the type of NoSQL database to be implemented (HBase, MongoDB, Cassandra, etc.) and justify your choice
 

Explain the types of treatment to be carried out:
explain how analyzing it can help explain why some regions have fewer students and how to fix it
 

Automation of SPARK processing workflows
• Analyze the data to draw crucial lessons related to the needs of the school
• Contribute in agile mode to Big Data projects
• Extract, study data and model according to school issues, do Machine Learning
• Orchestrate the data management of each project in compliance with regulatory / contractual procedures or frameworks (e.g. ISO9001, RGPD).
 

Secure data
 

Implementation :

We don't have a Supinfo student dataset, even if we had them, we couldn't make them available to students. So the project is a POC and therefore constitutes a draft of a Big Data and Data Science future platform for the school.
You can, for example, collect data from your class and extrapolate for the whole school.

You are free to choose the OS / language (Python, java, etc.) of your choice
Provide a web interface for managing your platform
Your platform must allow the following questions to be answered:
1 - Who are the most successful students, depending on the region / institution of origin, etc.
2 - Who are the students who stop their studies and why
3 -  Why there are more students in one region and few in another
4 -  How to revitalize campuses
5 -  What is the impact of a student fair on recruitments
6 -  What is the average length of time graduates are hired
7 -  Which companies recruit the most students from supinfo
8 -  Who are SUPINFO's competitors who are poaching our students
9 - Which regions have more Pro contracts and why

10 - What are the school's growth forecasts

12 - How to attract more students

13 - etc.
